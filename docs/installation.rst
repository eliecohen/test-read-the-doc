Lead-Like and Drug-Like Approaches
============

Chemists can now build and measure the 'lead-like' or 'drug-like' properties of molecules (concepts presented in another chapter). These provide useful structure-property relationships that complement current structure-activity information. These properties derive directly from molecular similarity structural analyses.

Similarity Searching in Database
--------------

Until the mid 1980s database searching was limited to exact and substructure search, i.e. the identification of all the molecules in the database that contain a specified substructure. Substructure searching is based on sub-graph algorithms that are computationally lengthy.

Similarity Searching
=============

The implementation of similarity principles in database searching was first introduced in the late 1980s. While substructural searching attempts exact retrieval of a certain substructure, in similarity searching, compounds (or parts of compounds) with different substructures but similar physico-chemical properties are identified
